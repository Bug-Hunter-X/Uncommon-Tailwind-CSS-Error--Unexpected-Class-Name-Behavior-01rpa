```javascript
// Corrected Tailwind class usage
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4 text-white">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>

//In this example, the original code might have used an incorrect class name. For example instead of `bg-red-500`, a typo might be made such as `bg-red-50` or `bg-red-5000`. The solution is to carefully review Tailwind's class name conventions and documentation to ensure the class names are correct.

// Further, using the Tailwind Playgroud or IntelliSense within your IDE can help prevent these errors from occurring in the first place.
